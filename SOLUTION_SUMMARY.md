# Solution Summary

## Issue

The error message indicates that there's a missing column in the database:

```
OperationalError at /settings/
no such column: subscriptions_currency.is_default
```

This is happening because a migration that adds the `is_default` field to the Currency model hasn't been applied in the Docker environment.

## Changes Made

1. Updated the `create_default_currencies.py` script to include the `is_default` field for each currency:
   - Set USD as the default currency (`is_default: True`)
   - Set EUR and GBP as non-default currencies (`is_default: False`)
   - Updated the `get_or_create` call to include the `is_default` field in the defaults dictionary

2. Created detailed instructions in `DOCKER_MIGRATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md` that explain:
   - The issue and its cause
   - Two solutions:
     - Option 1: Apply the migration in the running container (recommended, preserves data)
     - Option 2: Rebuild the Docker image and recreate the container (resets data)
   - How to prevent this issue in the future by modifying the Docker setup to run migrations on container start

## How This Resolves the Issue

The issue is caused by a mismatch between the model definition (which includes the `is_default` field) and the database schema (which doesn't have this field). By applying the migration, the database schema will be updated to include the `is_default` column, resolving the error.

The updated `create_default_currencies.py` script ensures that when currencies are created, they will have the `is_default` field set appropriately, with USD as the default currency.

## Next Steps for the User

The user should follow the instructions in `DOCKER_MIGRATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md` to apply the migration in their Docker environment. The recommended approach is to apply the migration in the running container, which preserves existing data.

For long-term stability, the user should consider modifying their Docker setup to run migrations on container start, as described in the instructions.
