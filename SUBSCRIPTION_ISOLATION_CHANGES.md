# Subscription Isolation Changes

## Overview
This document outlines the changes made to implement proper data isolation for subscriptions in the SubCal application. The issue was that new users could see all subscriptions in the system, rather than only seeing their own subscriptions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Model Changes
- Added a user field to the Subscription model to associate subscriptions with specific users:
  ```python
  user = models.ForeignKey(
      settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL,
      on_delete=models.CASCADE,
      related_name='subscriptions',
      null=True,
      blank=True
  )
  ```

### 2. View Updates
- Updated SubscriptionListView to use UserDataMixin to filter subscriptions by the current user
- Updated SubscriptionDetailView to use ObjectAccessMixin to ensure users can only view their own subscriptions
- Updated SubscriptionCreateView to set the user field to the current user
- Updated SubscriptionUpdateView to use ObjectAccessMixin to ensure users can only update their own subscriptions
- Updated SubscriptionDeleteView to use ObjectAccessMixin to ensure users can only delete their own subscriptions
- Updated home view to filter subscriptions by the current user
- Updated calendar_view to filter subscriptions by the current user
- Updated day_view to filter subscriptions by the current user
- Updated OverviewView to filter subscriptions by the current user
- Updated export_subscriptions_csv function to filter subscriptions by the current user
- Updated import_subscriptions_csv function to associate imported subscriptions with the current user

### 3. Migration
- Created a migration to assign existing subscriptions to users:
  - Gets all subscriptions without a user
  - Gets the first admin user, or creates one if none exists
  - Assigns all subscriptions without a user to the admin user

## Testing
To test these changes:
1. Create multiple user accounts
2. Add subscriptions for each user
3. Verify that each user can only see their own subscriptions
4. Verify that each user can only edit and delete their own subscriptions
5. Verify that imported subscriptions are associated with the current user

## Security Considerations
- All subscription-related views now require authentication
- Users can only access their own subscriptions
- Admin users can access all subscriptions through the admin interface
